                        I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where
                        I majored in both Business Management Economics and Computer Science. During my time
                        at UCSC, I was a part of the school's Women's Soccer Team and Alpha Kappa Psi - Chi Gamma Chapter.
                        From the courses I took to the memories I made, I learned so much about myself. I grew
                        fond of the power of data and the stories it tells when you dig deeper. After
                        realizing my excitement, I am currently working to find a job as an analyst.

                        I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I majored in both Business
                        Management Economics and Computer Science. My time at UCSC was marked by a blend of academic rigor and
                        rich extracurricular involvement. As a dedicated member of the Womenâ€™s Soccer Team, I learned the value
                        of teamwork, discipline, and balancing multiple commitments, which significantly shaped my approach to
                        problem-solving and leadership. Simultaneously, my role in Alpha Kappa Psi - Chi Gamma Chapter allowed me
                        to develop strong professional skills and build a network of peers and mentors.

                        Throughout my studies, I was particularly captivated by the power of data and the stories it can
                        reveal when analyzed thoughtfully. Courses in both business and computer science provided me with a
                        robust foundation in data analysis, programming, and economic theory, reinforcing my appreciation for
                        how data-driven insights can inform decision-making and strategy. My involvement in various projects
                        and academic work deepened this interest, leading me to pursue a career as an analyst.

                        Now, I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences in a role that allows me to explore and communicate
                        the narratives hidden within data. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a team where I can
                        continue to grow professionally while applying my analytical skills to real-world challenges.
