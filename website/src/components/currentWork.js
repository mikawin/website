                            Recently, I have been focused on obtaining the Microsoft Power BI certification. To achieve
                            this goal, I have been working on completing online courses and practice exams to
                            prepare for the certification requirements.
                            With this new technology in my toolkit, I'll be well-equipped to produce high-quality
                            data visualizations efficiently in my next role.

                            In addition to my certification efforts, I have also been dedicating time to creating this
                            personal website. This project serves a dual purpose: it allows me to explore and experiment
                            with new web development technologies while also helping me maintain and refine the skills Iâ€™ve
                            already acquired. Through this project, I am continually learning and staying current with the
                            latest trends and techniques in web development.
